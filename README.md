# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

   To check your version of git, run:

   ```shell
    git --version
   ```

2. node 
   
   `node` version 16.15.1 or higher. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already.

   To check your version of node, run:

   ```shell
    node --version
   ```

3. npm
  
   `npm` version 5.6.1 or higher. You will have it after you install node.

   To check your version of npm, run:

   ```shell
    npm --version
   ```

## Setup

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/project1_team4_repository.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd project1_team4_repository
    ```

3. Install the dependencies
   
    ```shell
     npm install
    ```

    If you get an error, please check the console for more information.

## Issues

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/projects/8). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.


## Pull Request

There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:

* Pull Request from a [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* Pull Request from a branch within a repository

Here we are going to focus on 2. Creating a Topical Branch:


1. First, we will need to create a branch from the latest commit on master. Make sure your repository is up to date first using

   ```bash
    git pull origin main
   ```

   *Note:* `git pull` does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge` to update the local repo with the remote repo. For a more detailed explanation, see [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/whats-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch).

2. To create a branch, use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>]`, where `base-branch-name` is optional and defaults to `main`. 
   
   Use a standard convention for branch names. For example, `<your-name>-dev`. It will be easier to track your pull requests if you use this convention.
   
   I'm going to create a new branch called `jsm-dev` from the `main` branch and push it to github.

   ```bash
    git checkout -b jsm-dev main
    git push origin jsm-dev
   ```

3. To create a pull request, you must have changes committed to your new branch.

4. Go to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/project1_team4_repository/pulls) and click on the `New Pull Request` button.

5. Select the `main` branch as the `base` branch and the `jsm-dev` branch as the `compare` branch.

6. Follow the template and fill in the proper information for the pull request.

7. Click on the `Submit` button.

8. You have successfully created a pull request. Now wait for mentor approval. Once approved, you can merge the pull request.
